# Thought Patterns Orchestration Skill

This skill provides access to a comprehensive library of human cognitive thinking patterns. It includes an intelligent orchestration system that selects and chains appropriate patterns based on task requirements.

## Quick Reference: When to Load Which Resource

| Task Type | Load Resource |
|-----------|---------------|
| Debugging, troubleshooting, system analysis | `resources/foundational-patterns.md` |
| Logic problems, hypothesis generation, learning new concepts | `resources/reasoning-patterns.md` |
| Brainstorming, innovation, creative ideation | `resources/creative-patterns.md` |
| Learning from experience, improving processes, self-regulation | `resources/metacognitive-patterns.md` |
| User-centered design, constrained optimization, iteration | `resources/specialized-patterns.md` |
| Leveraging ADHD/autism/dyslexia cognitive strengths | `resources/neurodivergent-strengths.md` |
| Complex multi-pattern examples, pattern chaining | `resources/pattern-combinations.md` |

## Orchestration Protocol

### Phase 1: Task Analysis

Before selecting a pattern, analyze the task:

**Task Type Classification:**
- **Analytical**: Breaking down complex information, logical reasoning → Load foundational
- **Creative**: Novel ideas, innovative solutions → Load creative
- **Exploratory**: Investigating possibilities, understanding relationships → Load reasoning
- **Strategic**: Planning, decision-making, optimization → Load foundational + metacognitive
- **Reflective**: Learning from experience, examining assumptions → Load metacognitive
- **Explanatory**: Root causes, generating hypotheses → Load reasoning
- **Integrative**: Combining perspectives, synthesis → Load multiple resources

**Complexity Indicators:**
- Single vs. multiple objectives
- Well-defined vs. ambiguous constraints
- Known vs. unknown solution space
- Independent vs. interdependent components

### Phase 2: Pattern Selection

Based on task analysis, load the appropriate resource file(s) and select patterns:

- **Single Pattern**: When task clearly maps to one approach
- **Sequential Chain**: When one pattern feeds into another (e.g., divergent → convergent)
- **Parallel Patterns**: When multiple simultaneous perspectives add value
- **Iterative Loop**: When refinement through repeated application is needed

### Phase 3: Execution & Validation

**During Execution:**
- Explicitly apply the selected pattern(s)
- Show your work when beneficial to user understanding
- Monitor whether the pattern is yielding progress
- Switch patterns if current approach is ineffective

**Before Responding:**
- Validate completeness: Did you address all aspects of the task?
- Check coherence: Does the output logically follow from the thinking process?
- Assess quality: Does this meet the standard the user expects?

## Pattern Selection Heuristics

### By Problem Type

**Well-Defined Problems** → Load `foundational-patterns.md`
- Sequential, Analytical, Deductive, Convergent patterns

**Ill-Defined Problems** → Load `creative-patterns.md` + `reasoning-patterns.md`
- Divergent, Lateral, Abductive, Design Thinking patterns

**Complex Systems** → Load `foundational-patterns.md`
- Systems Thinking, Holistic/Gestalt, Parallel Processing patterns

**Creative Tasks** → Load `creative-patterns.md`
- Divergent, Lateral, Associative, Analogical patterns

**Learning/Improvement** → Load `metacognitive-patterns.md`
- Reflective, Metacognitive, Double-Loop Learning patterns

**Strategic Decisions** → Load `foundational-patterns.md` + `reasoning-patterns.md`
- Big-Picture, Systems, Counterfactual, First Principles patterns

**Detailed Analysis** → Load `foundational-patterns.md` + `neurodivergent-strengths.md`
- Analytical, Detail-Oriented Pattern Recognition, Critical Thinking

**Quick Responses** → No resource load needed
- System 1, Pattern Recognition, Associative

**Important/Novel Decisions** → Load `metacognitive-patterns.md` + `reasoning-patterns.md`
- System 2, Critical, Analytical, First Principles patterns

### Neurodivergent Pattern Integration

Always consider whether neurodivergent patterns might enhance the solution:

- **ADHD patterns** (Hyperfocus, Big-Picture): For engaging problems requiring sustained effort or strategic overview
- **Autism patterns** (Detail-Oriented): For precision, consistency, pattern finding
- **Dyslexia patterns** (Spatial/Visual): For spatial problems, visual creativity, 3D reasoning
- **Non-Linear Associative**: For creative breakthroughs, cross-domain insights

→ Load `resources/neurodivergent-strengths.md` when these would add value

## Common Pattern Chains

For complex tasks requiring multiple patterns, see `resources/pattern-combinations.md` for detailed examples:

1. **Creative Problem-Solving**: Divergent → Convergent
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Analytical → Abductive → Systems
3. **Innovation**: First Principles → Lateral → Design Thinking
4. **Learning**: Reflective → Double-Loop → Metacognitive
5. **Comprehensive Understanding**: Analytical → Gestalt → Systems
6. **Strategic Decision**: Big-Picture → Analytical → Counterfactual
