# Thought Patterns Orchestration Skill

This skill provides access to a comprehensive library of human cognitive thinking patterns, including both neurotypical and neurodivergent approaches. It includes an intelligent orchestration system that selects and chains appropriate patterns based on task requirements.

## Core Purpose

Enable Claude to leverage diverse cognitive strategies by:
1. **Analyzing** the task to understand requirements and constraints
2. **Selecting** the most appropriate thinking pattern(s) from the comprehensive library
3. **Chaining** multiple patterns when a single approach is insufficient
4. **Executing** the thinking process using the selected pattern(s)
5. **Validating** the output before presenting to the user

## Orchestration Protocol

### Phase 1: Task Analysis

Before selecting a pattern, analyze the task along these dimensions:

**Task Type Classification:**
- **Analytical**: Requires breaking down complex information, logical reasoning, systematic evaluation
- **Creative**: Needs novel ideas, innovative solutions, unconventional approaches
- **Exploratory**: Investigating possibilities, understanding relationships, discovering patterns
- **Strategic**: Planning, decision-making, optimization, trade-off analysis
- **Reflective**: Learning from experience, examining assumptions, improving processes
- **Explanatory**: Making sense of observations, finding root causes, generating hypotheses
- **Integrative**: Combining multiple perspectives, synthesizing information, holistic understanding

**Complexity Indicators:**
- Single vs. multiple objectives
- Well-defined vs. ambiguous constraints
- Known vs. unknown solution space
- Independent vs. interdependent components
- Static vs. dynamic environment
- Concrete vs. abstract concepts

**Cognitive Strengths to Leverage:**
- Consider if neurodivergent patterns might offer advantages
- Identify whether visual/spatial, verbal, or kinesthetic processing would help
- Determine if detailed analysis or big-picture thinking is more valuable
- Assess whether speed or depth is prioritized

### Phase 2: Pattern Selection

Based on the task analysis, select one or more patterns from the library below. You may select:
- **Single Pattern**: When task clearly maps to one approach
- **Sequential Chain**: When one pattern should feed into another (e.g., divergent → convergent)
- **Parallel Patterns**: When multiple simultaneous perspectives add value
- **Iterative Loop**: When refinement through repeated application is needed

### Phase 3: Execution & Validation

**During Execution:**
- Explicitly apply the selected pattern(s)
- Show your work when beneficial to user understanding
- Monitor whether the pattern is yielding progress
- Switch patterns if current approach is ineffective

**Before Responding:**
- Validate completeness: Did you address all aspects of the task?
- Check coherence: Does the output logically follow from the thinking process?
- Assess quality: Does this meet the standard the user expects?
- Consider alternatives: Would a different pattern have been better? (Learn for future)

## Comprehensive Pattern Library

## Pattern Chaining Strategies

Some tasks benefit from explicitly chaining multiple patterns in sequence:

### Common Chains

1. **Creative Problem-Solving Chain**:
   - Divergent Thinking → Convergent Thinking
   - Generate many options, then select best

2. **Root Cause Analysis Chain**:
   - Analytical Thinking → Abductive Reasoning → Systems Thinking
   - Break down problem → Find best explanation → Understand system context

3. **Innovation Chain**:
   - First Principles Thinking → Lateral Thinking → Design Thinking
   - Strip to fundamentals → Challenge assumptions → Build user-centered solution

4. **Learning Chain**:
   - Reflective Thinking → Double-Loop Learning → Metacognitive Thinking
   - Reflect on experience → Question assumptions → Monitor thinking process

5. **Comprehensive Understanding Chain**:
   - Analytical Thinking → Gestalt/Holistic → Systems Thinking
   - Understand parts → Grasp whole → Understand relationships and emergence

6. **Strategic Decision Chain**:
   - Big-Picture Thinking → Analytical Thinking → Counterfactual Reasoning
   - Understand context → Analyze options → Consider alternatives

### Parallel Pattern Application

Some tasks benefit from applying multiple patterns simultaneously:

1. **Complex Analysis**:
   - System 1 (intuition) + System 2 (analysis)
   - Analytical + Holistic perspectives

2. **Comprehensive Problem-Solving**:
   - Deductive + Inductive + Abductive reasoning together

3. **Neurodivergent Strengths**:
   - Detail-Oriented Pattern Recognition + Big-Picture Thinking
   - Combine precision and strategy

## Implementation Guidelines

### For Each Task:

1. **Read and understand the user's request completely**

2. **Conduct Task Analysis** (brief, internal):
   - What type of task is this?
   - What's the complexity level?
   - What cognitive strengths would help?

3. **Select Pattern(s)**:
   - Choose primary pattern
   - Identify any secondary or chained patterns
   - Consider whether parallel patterns add value

4. **Execute Thinking Process**:
   - Apply selected pattern(s) systematically
   - Show work when it aids user understanding
   - Monitor effectiveness

5. **Validate Output**:
   - Completeness check
   - Coherence check
   - Quality assessment
   - Alternative consideration (for learning)

6. **Respond to User**:
   - Provide final output
   - Optionally explain thinking approach if relevant

### Pattern Selection Heuristics

**For Well-Defined Problems**: Sequential, Analytical, Deductive, Convergent

**For Ill-Defined Problems**: Divergent, Lateral, Abductive, Design Thinking

**For Understanding Complex Systems**: Systems Thinking, Holistic/Gestalt, Parallel Processing

**For Creative Tasks**: Divergent, Lateral, Associative, Analogical

**For Learning/Improvement**: Reflective, Metacognitive, Double-Loop Learning

**For Strategic Decisions**: Big-Picture, Systems, Counterfactual, First Principles

**For Detailed Analysis**: Analytical, Detail-Oriented Pattern Recognition, Critical Thinking

**For Quick Responses**: System 1, Pattern Recognition, Associative

**For Important/Novel Decisions**: System 2, Critical, Analytical, First Principles

### Neurodivergent Pattern Integration

Always consider whether neurodivergent patterns might enhance the solution:

- **ADHD patterns** (Hyperfocus, Big-Picture): For engaging problems requiring sustained effort or strategic overview
- **Autism patterns** (Detail-Oriented): For precision, consistency, pattern finding
- **Dyslexia patterns** (Spatial/Visual): For spatial problems, visual creativity, 3D reasoning
- **Non-Linear Associative**: For creative breakthroughs, cross-domain insights

These aren't separate from "standard" patterns—they're additional cognitive strategies that add value.

## Self-Monitoring

After using this skill several times, periodically reflect:

- Are you actually using the pattern library, or defaulting to familiar approaches?
- Are you conducting task analysis before pattern selection?
- Are you chaining patterns when appropriate?
- Are you considering neurodivergent patterns?
- Are you validating outputs before responding?

This metacognitive check ensures the skill remains actively beneficial rather than becoming superficial.
