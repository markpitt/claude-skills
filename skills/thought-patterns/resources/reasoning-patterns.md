# Reasoning Patterns

This resource covers formal and informal reasoning patterns used for logical inference, hypothesis generation, learning, and challenging assumptions.

## Deductive Reasoning

**Description**: Moving from general principles to specific conclusions; if premises are true, conclusion must be true.

**When to Use**:
- Applying known rules or laws
- Mathematical proofs
- Logical inference
- Certain knowledge domains

**Process**:
1. State general principle/rule
2. Identify specific case
3. Apply rule to case
4. Derive certain conclusion

**Example**: 
- All humans are mortal (general)
- Socrates is human (specific)
- Therefore, Socrates is mortal (conclusion)

**Limitations**: Only as good as premises; doesn't generate new knowledge beyond premises.

## Inductive Reasoning

**Description**: Moving from specific observations to general principles; probabilistic rather than certain.

**When to Use**:
- Pattern identification from data
- Hypothesis generation
- Trend analysis
- Building general understanding from examples

**Process**:
1. Collect specific observations
2. Identify patterns and regularities
3. Formulate general principle
4. Test generalization with new cases

**Example**:
- Observed: Swan 1 is white, Swan 2 is white, Swan 3 is white...
- Conclusion: All swans are white (probabilistic, can be disproven)

**Limitations**: Conclusions are probable, not certain; vulnerable to sampling bias.

## Abductive Reasoning

**Description**: Inference to the best explanation; finding the simplest and most likely explanation for observations.

**When to Use**:
- Diagnostic problems
- Mystery or puzzle solving
- Scientific hypothesis formation
- Explaining unexpected observations

**Process**:
1. Observe surprising or puzzling facts
2. Generate possible explanations
3. Evaluate explanations (simplicity, likelihood, explanatory power)
4. Select best explanation
5. Remain open to revision with new evidence

**Cognitive Requirements**:
- Generate multiple hypotheses
- Evaluate evidence relevance
- Compare competing explanations
- Revise flexibly with new data

**Example**:
- Observation: The grass is wet
- Possible explanations: Rain, sprinkler, dew, spilled water
- Best explanation (given context): It rained last night

**Limitations**: Best explanation may not be correct; requires creativity in hypothesis generation.

## Analogical Reasoning

**Description**: Drawing connections between a familiar domain (source/analog) and new domain (target) to transfer knowledge.

**When to Use**:
- Learning new concepts
- Creative problem-solving
- Explaining complex ideas
- Finding solutions by analogy

**Process**:
1. Identify target problem
2. Recall similar source domain
3. Map correspondences between domains
4. Transfer relationships and solutions
5. Adapt to target context

**Example**:
- Source: The atom is like a solar system
- Mapping: Nucleus = Sun, Electrons = Planets
- Transfer: Electrons orbit the nucleus like planets orbit the sun

**Note**: Peirce considered analogy a compound form integrating abduction and induction; important source of human creativity.

**Limitations**: Analogies can mislead if domains differ in crucial ways.

## Counterfactual Reasoning

**Description**: Mental simulation of alternative scenarios; "what might have been" thinking.

**When to Use**:
- Learning from mistakes
- Contingency planning
- Understanding causation
- Improving future decisions

**Process**:
1. Identify actual outcome
2. Imagine alternative actions/conditions
3. Simulate alternative outcome
4. Compare factual and counterfactual
5. Extract lessons for future

**Types**:
- **Upward counterfactuals**: How it could have been better
- **Downward counterfactuals**: How it could have been worse
- **Additive**: Adding something that wasn't there
- **Subtractive**: Removing something that was there

**Functional Purpose**: Avoid repeating mistakes; prepare for similar future situations.

**Limitations**: Can lead to regret or rumination if overused.

## First Principles Thinking

**Description**: Breaking down problems to fundamental truths and building up from there; questioning all assumptions.

**When to Use**:
- Innovation challenges
- Breaking through conventional wisdom
- Fundamental understanding
- When existing approaches fail

**Process**:
1. Identify current assumptions/beliefs
2. Break down to foundational truths
3. Question everything that isn't fundamental
4. Rebuild understanding from first principles
5. Construct new approach

**Example**:
- Conventional: "Batteries are expensive"
- First principles: "What are batteries made of? Cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon, polymers. What are the raw material costs? How can we acquire or produce these more efficiently?"
- Result: Rethink battery production from fundamentals

**Elon Musk's approach**: "Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy."

**Limitations**: Time-intensive; may reinvent wheel unnecessarily for routine problems.

## Reasoning Type Comparison

| Type | Direction | Certainty | Best For |
|------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Deductive | General → Specific | Certain | Applying rules |
| Inductive | Specific → General | Probable | Finding patterns |
| Abductive | Observation → Explanation | Best guess | Diagnosis/hypothesis |
| Analogical | Domain → Domain | Transferred | Learning/creativity |
| Counterfactual | Actual → Alternative | Simulated | Learning/planning |
| First Principles | Assumptions → Fundamentals | Reconstructed | Innovation |

## Common Chains

1. **Scientific Method**: Inductive → Abductive → Deductive
   - Observe patterns → Form hypothesis → Test predictions

2. **Problem-Solving**: First Principles → Analogical
   - Strip to fundamentals → Find analogous solutions

3. **Decision Review**: Counterfactual → Inductive
   - Simulate alternatives → Extract general lessons

4. **Explanation**: Abductive → Analogical
   - Find best explanation → Explain via familiar analogy
