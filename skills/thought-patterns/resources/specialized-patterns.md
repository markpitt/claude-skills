# Specialized Problem-Solving Patterns

This resource covers domain-specific and methodological patterns for user-centered design, constrained optimization, parallel analysis, and iterative development.

## Design Thinking

**Description**: Human-centered approach to innovation emphasizing empathy, ideation, and iterative prototyping.

**When to Use**:
- User-centered problems
- Innovation challenges
- Ambiguous problem spaces
- Requiring creative solutions
- Product/service development

**Process**:

### 1. Empathize
Understand user needs deeply:
- Conduct interviews
- Observe behavior in context
- Build empathy maps
- Identify pain points and desires
- Challenge assumptions about users

### 2. Define
Articulate the problem clearly:
- Synthesize observations
- Create point-of-view statement
- "How might we..." questions
- Focus on user needs, not solutions

### 3. Ideate
Generate many solutions:
- Brainstorm widely (divergent)
- Build on ideas
- Encourage wild concepts
- Defer judgment
- Combine and improve

### 4. Prototype
Build representations:
- Low-fidelity first
- Fast and cheap
- Test specific aspects
- Learn through making
- "Fail fast, learn fast"

### 5. Test
Gather feedback:
- Put prototypes in front of users
- Observe, don't defend
- Ask open questions
- Identify what works/doesn't
- Refine understanding

### 6. Iterate
Refine based on learning:
- Return to any previous phase
- Multiple cycles expected
- Progressively higher fidelity
- Converge on solution

**Key Principles**:
- Bias toward action
- Embrace experimentation
- Radical collaboration
- Mindfulness of process
- Show don't tell

**Limitations**: Can be time-intensive; requires user access.

## Constraint-Based Thinking

**Description**: Using limitations as creative drivers and solution frameworks.

**When to Use**:
- Resource-limited situations
- Focused creativity needed
- Optimization problems
- When constraints clarify direction
- Budget/time restrictions

**Process**:
1. **Identify all constraints**
   - Resources (money, time, people)
   - Technical limitations
   - Requirements and must-haves
   - Legal/regulatory bounds
   - Physical constraints

2. **Categorize constraints**
   - Hard constraints (cannot be violated)
   - Soft constraints (prefer to honor)
   - Assumed constraints (may be questionable)

3. **Treat constraints as creative challenges**
   - "Because we can't X, we must find another way"
   - Constraint forces innovation
   - Limitation breeds creativity

4. **Generate solutions within boundaries**
   - Work within hard constraints
   - Optimize soft constraints
   - Question assumed constraints

5. **Question constraint validity**
   - Is this really a constraint?
   - Who imposed it and why?
   - What happens if we violate it?
   - Can we negotiate or change it?

**Creative Constraint Examples**:
- "We only have one week" → Focus on MVP
- "Budget is $100" → Find free alternatives
- "Must fit in one screen" → Ruthless prioritization

**Strengths**: Focus, creativity through limitation, realistic solutions.

**Limitations**: May miss opportunities from relaxing constraints.

## Parallel Processing

**Description**: Simultaneously considering multiple aspects, hypotheses, or approaches.

**When to Use**:
- Complex multi-faceted problems
- When single-thread insufficient
- Exploring multiple hypotheses
- Comprehensive analysis needed
- Time permits deep exploration

**Process**:
1. **Identify multiple threads to process**
   - Different aspects of problem
   - Competing hypotheses
   - Various stakeholder perspectives
   - Alternative approaches

2. **Hold multiple perspectives simultaneously**
   - Don't collapse to single view too early
   - Maintain uncertainty where appropriate
   - Track evidence for each thread

3. **Process different aspects in parallel**
   - Assign mental "resources" to each
   - Use external aids if needed (notes, diagrams)
   - Switch between threads deliberately

4. **Integrate findings**
   - Look for convergence across threads
   - Note contradictions
   - Synthesize into coherent picture

5. **Identify interactions between threads**
   - How do aspects influence each other?
   - Are there unexpected connections?
   - What emerges from the combination?

**Note**: Connectionist models use parallel processing across web-like structures with top-down and bottom-up processes.

**Tools to Support Parallel Processing**:
- Mind maps
- Comparison tables
- Multiple hypothesis tracking
- Kanban boards
- Split-screen analysis

**Limitations**: Cognitively demanding; may require external aids (writing, diagrams).

## Iterative Refinement

**Description**: Progressively improving solutions through repeated cycles of execution, evaluation, and modification.

**When to Use**:
- Complex problems without clear solution
- Creative work
- Software development
- Continuous improvement
- Learning new skills

**Process**:
1. **Create initial version**
   - Don't aim for perfection
   - "Good enough to evaluate"
   - Establish baseline

2. **Evaluate against criteria**
   - Define success metrics
   - Test with users/stakeholders
   - Compare to requirements
   - Identify gaps

3. **Identify improvements**
   - What's working well? (keep it)
   - What's not working? (change it)
   - What's missing? (add it)
   - What's unnecessary? (remove it)

4. **Implement changes**
   - Prioritize high-impact changes
   - Make one change at a time if debugging
   - Document what changed and why

5. **Repeat until satisfactory**
   - Define stopping criteria upfront
   - Watch for diminishing returns
   - Know when "good enough" is reached

**Iteration Strategies**:

### Timeboxed Iterations
- Fixed time periods (sprints)
- Deliver what's possible in the box
- Regular cadence

### Quality Thresholds
- Define minimum quality bar
- Iterate until bar is met
- Raise bar over time

### Feedback-Driven
- Each iteration responds to feedback
- User/stakeholder input drives priorities
- Adaptive to changing needs

**Limitations**: Can be time-consuming; need clear stopping criteria.
